# Lead Scoring Case Study

### Overview:

This project involves building a logistic regression model to help X Education, an online course provider, identify potential leads who are most likely to convert into customers. 
The goal is to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion. By identifying these "Hot Leads," the company can focus its sales efforts more efficiently, potentially improving its conversion rate.

### Project Objective:
•	Objective: To develop a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score to each lead, helping the sales team at X Education target the most promising leads.

•	Goal: Improve the conversion rate by focusing on high-potential leads.

### Steps involved:
1.	Importing modules
2.	Reading and Understanding Data
3.	Data Cleaning
4.	Data Visualization(EDA)
5.	Data Preparation
6.	Building the Logistic Regression Model
7.	Model Evaluation
8.	ROC curve, Precision-Recall Trade-off and their optimal cut-off values
9.	Making Predictions on test data

### Files Provided:

1. Lead_Scoring_CS.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the code and data analysis.
2. Sub_Q&A_Lead_Scoring_CS.pdf: A document with answers to some subjective questions.
3. PPT_Lead_Scoring_CS.pdf: The final presentation summarizing the project.
4. Summary_Lead_Scoring_CS.pdf: A Brief summary of the work done in the Jupyter notebook.

### Conclusion:
The logistic regression model developed in this project aims to enhance the efficiency of the sales process at X Education by accurately scoring leads. This will enable the sales team to prioritize high-potential leads, ultimately improving the conversion rate.
